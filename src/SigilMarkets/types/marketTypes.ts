 * SigilMarkets — marketTypes (normative)

 * Design goals:
 * - Deterministic, reconstructable market state from a stream of events.
 * - Kai-Klok native time: pulses are the only wall-clock we care about here.
 * - Value units are represented as integer micro-units for stability.
 *
 * Units:
 * - PhiMicro: integer micro-Φ (1 Φ = 1_000_000 microΦ)
 * - ShareMicro: integer micro-shares (1 share = 1_000_000 microShares)
 * - PriceMicro: microΦ per 1 share (0..ONE_PHI_MICRO, where 1 share redeems ONE_PHI_MICRO on win)
